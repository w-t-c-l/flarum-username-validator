Flarum extension for my forum for Pokemon Johto. Can easily be modified for however you want to limit available characters and rules for usernames. Does not include any profanity blocking. As it is without modifications, it limits a username to 12 characters. The allowed characters are alpha numeric and spaces. Spaces are not allowed to be at the start or the end of the username and they are not allowed to be used consecutively.
